# Dataset description 
The pickle file contains the datasets concerning the 88 days of rainfall measurements described in the article "". The data have been collected using sensors mounted on two parabolic dishes having a diameter of 60cm and 85cm, respectively. 

Open the datasets using the pickle library for python with the following commands:

```ruby
import pickle as pk 

datasetPath = "SRS_dataset_88days.pkl"  
with open(datasetPath, "rb") as f:  
   dataset = pk.load(f) 
   f.close()  
```

The *dataset* is a dictionary containing the 88 days SRS measurements expressed in mV for both dishes, the 88 days TBRG measurements expressed in mm/min, and the timestamps of the measurements.

The days of observations are listed in the table which summarizes the dataset, displaying the ID assigned to each day, the total accumulation of rain in mm (h), the maximum rainfall
intensity in mm/h (max RI) observed by the TBRG, the number of rainy minutes (d), the freezing level in m. The elevation angle of the sensors with respect to the Turksat dataset is 29.2048Â°.

# Experiments conducted in the article

The anomaly detection algorithm (ADA) was trained offline by using the first non-rainy days of the dataset, i.e. days 4, 6, 8, 9, 11. 
The machine learning algorithms (MLAs) were trained on 10 days, the same 5 of ADA and 5 containing rain observations, i.e. days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7.

## Algorithms

*Anomaly Detection Algorithm (ADA)* works as an anomaly detection algorithm where we consider as normal data the non-rainy observations and as anomalies the rainy ones. Thus the training dataset consists of only non-rainy data used to compute some thresholds on the normal data to identify the anomalies. In particular, ADA relies on the heuristic evaluation of three parameters: the minimum signal power $P_R^{min}$, the difference between two consecutive observations $\Delta P_R$, and the standard deviation $stdev$, which is computed over a window of previous observations. 

A new SRS observation (in dBm) $x_t$ is classified as follows, based on the previous label $y_{t-1} \in [True; False]$: 

first_cond = (($x_t$ - $x_{t-1}$) $<-\Delta P_R$ ) | ($x_t < P_R^{min}$)

second_cond = std($[x_{t-10}, x_{t-9}, x_{t-8}, x_{t-7}, x_{t-6}, x_{t-5}, x_{t-4}, x_{t-3}, x_{t-2}, x_{t-1}]$) > $stdev$

third_cond = std($[x_{t-10}, x_{t-9}, x_{t-8}, x_{t-7}, x_{t-6}, x_{t-5}, x_{t-4}, x_{t-3}, x_{t-2}, x_{t-1}]$) < $stdev$/4

fourth_cond = std($[x_{t-20},x_{t-19},x_{t-18},x_{t-17},x_{t-16},x_{t-15},x_{t-14},x_{t-13},x_{t-12},x_{t-11},x_{t-10},x_{t-9}, x_{t-8}, x_{t-7}, x_{t-6}, x_{t-5}, x_{t-4}, x_{t-3}, x_{t-2}, x_{t-1}]$) < $stdev$/2

if (first_cond | second_cond) and not $y_{t-1}$:
   
      $y_{t}$ = True

elif (third_cond | fourth_cond) and $y_{t-1}$:

      $y_{t}$ = False


The algorithms have been tested on the other days, i.e. 45 non-rainy days and 33 rainy days. 

You can find an example of code here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dI-YVUWwamK7uMeWmz-XSzjyuDcetw9g#scrollTo=Oe1pdErmsruG.
You can change the radius of the dish, the classifier choosing between ANN, CNN, or ADA, and the event you want to test from 0 to 77 corresponding to one day in the test set.
